These examples explained are in [Testing: Cable and Chain](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/testing-cable-chain-mark-windholtz/)

Run the tests
  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Run tests `mix test`


NOTE: Phoenix server not currently used in these examples.
(but I hope to add Phoenix exaples in the future)
To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
